### Changes for v2019.0515
It's been a while since my last update.  Nothing to get excited about with this release - there's only a few minor changes.  This application is definitely due for a new look and some new features.  Hopefully soon!

* The __users__ section now includes each user's domain when listing logged on users.  Previously, only their username was listed.
* The auto-fill that suggests target computer names as you type was limited to retrieving 1000 computer objects from AD.  That limit has been removed.  (As before, this search happens one time in a background thread when the application opens.  It's used to populate the auto-fill list.)


### Changes for v2017.1213
* New section: Networking.  This section includes a new remote netstat feature which gives the ability to view all TCP/UDP listening and established connections on the target computer.
* Details for network adapters was moved from the System Info section to the new Networking section.

**Check out the new feature under Networking -> Netstat.**  This is just like running the netstat command, but on a remote computer.  View all established connections as well as which ports that are open and which process is listening on a given port.  I've been sitting on this feature for a while and finally decided to push it out.  It'll eventually improve to include process names and paths, resolving IPs to hostnames, filtering, refreshing, and better sorting.


### Changes for v2017.1107
* Tasks -> Group Policy Update: GPupdate was only updating the computer policy on remote computers.  It now updates the user policy as well.  To achieve this, Splice Admin does several tricks.  1) Create a temporary .VBS file to run gpupdate.exe in a hidden window.  2) Get a list of logged in users.  3) For each user, create a scheduled task that executes the .VBS script (this will execute in the context of each logged in user).  4)  Run the task and then remove the temporary file and task.
* Bulk Query:  You can now use wildcards when searching for files.   For example: C:\Windows\\*.exe


### Older changes
* Bug fix: Corrected LDAP queries used in the Bulk Query view.
* The Processes, Services, and Applications views now include a filter feature.  Type in a search phrase and the results are automatically filtered as you type.
* Bug fix: In the Bulk Query view, targeting 'All domain computers' no longer causes a crash.
* Bulk query:  Added the ability to search for registry values.  You can either retrieve a specific value, or you can search for a key and all values within that key will be returned.  For example, searching for hklm\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\run, would return all startup applications for every computer in your target list.  Target operating system must be Vista/2008 or higher at this time.
* Completely revamped the bulk query feature.  Rather than a simple 'match' or 'no match', searches now include detailed results.  For example, if searching for installed applications and your search phrase is 'adobe', you will get a list which includes the full title of every application with 'adobe' in the name, as well as the version number, for every computer in your target list.   When searching services, search results will include the startup type and the current status of the service.
* Bulk query:  The pre-defined target computer groups now exclude disabled computers.
* Bulk query:  New option to only include computers that have been active in the past 30 days.
* Bulk query:  Added the ability to search for running processes.
* Applications:  Remote applications were previously retrieved through the Remote Registry service.  The registry values are now retrieved through WMI which results in faster data retrieval.  The application will fall back to using the Remote Registry service if the target OS does not support the WMI registry provider.
* Bulk query:  Searching for applications now also goes through the WMI registry provider with a fallback to remote registry.  This results in faster application searches.
* Added: Tasks -> Windows Remote Assistance.  A shortcut to connect to the target computer using the Windows Remote Assistance tool.  This will only work if your environment is configured to allow unsolicited remote assistance.
